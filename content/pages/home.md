# Land Systems and Public Ecology

ZenTrust is a 501(c)(3) public charity that conducts research and provides public education on regenerative agriculture, environmental patterns, and community resilience. This site presents educational material for public understanding.

## Our Focus

We document patterns in:

- **Regenerative Agriculture Research**: Studying how soil health responds to different agricultural approaches
- **Environmental Observation**: Examining patterns in degraded land recovery and ecosystem restoration
- **Community Patterns**: Documenting how communities engage with environmental stewardship
- **Ecological Research**: Advancing understanding of sustainable practices through scientific study

## Research Approach

Our work observes systems rather than implementing solutions:

- Documenting what works in different contexts
- Studying patterns across multiple watersheds
- Publishing findings for public education
- Collaborating with researchers worldwide

This site presents educational content for those interested in regenerative systems and environmental patterns.
