## Answer

When soil life, water holding, and plant diversity are removed, the land stops completing its own cycles. Fertilizer, irrigation, and chemicals keep production going but deepen dependency. Syntropic ecology reverses this by rebuilding relationships instead of adding more inputs.

### What changes

- **Structure returns**: mixed canopies, continuous cover, and deep roots hold water and protect soil life.
- **Cycles close**: pruned biomass feeds the ground, and shade slows evaporation so moisture stays available.
- **Labor shifts**: effort moves from constant rescue to guiding succession so the system maintains itself.

### Why it stays stable

The design mirrors a forest: layered plants, continuous organic matter, and cooperative function. When these are present, the land begins repairing itself and the need for emergency fixes declines.
