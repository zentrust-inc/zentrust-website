heroText: "Because extractive designs replace the relationships that let land repair itself, so every fix treats symptoms instead of restoring the system."

## Answer

A field can look healthy while its underlying relationships unravel. Fertilizer keeps plants green while soil life thins. Irrigation keeps yields steady while water cycles weaken. Each fix works briefly because it replaces what the ecosystem once handled on its own.

Regeneration starts by asking what the land used to do for itself. In healthy systems, plants shield soil, roots hold water, and decaying matter feeds new life. When those links break, the land needs constant rescue. When they return, the land begins repairing itself again.

### How to read this room

- Notice where effort is replacing a missing relationship.
- Look for ways to restore the original cycle instead of adding another input.
- Expect healing to come from design changes, not harder labor.
