## Answer

Imagine living beneath a roof with a small leak. Buckets keep the floor dry and mops keep people safe. The house looks fine, yet tension returns every time clouds gather. The fixes help, but they do not stop the rain.

Health can feel like that roof. Medications protect organs and calm pain, but if chronic stress, isolation, or meaninglessness continue, the body never fully relaxes. The conditions that drive stress keep dripping into the system.

### What changes the feeling

- Treat the leak, not just the puddle: address the social, psychological, and spiritual layers alongside biology.
- Restore the protective layers together: safety, nourishment, community, and purpose reinforce one another.
- Measure ease, not only symptoms: healing feels like the roof holding, not just better buckets.
