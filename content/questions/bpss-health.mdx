## Answer

Pain can ease and numbers can improve while the body remains tense. If chronic stress, isolation, or loss of meaning continue, the nervous system keeps responding even when medications help. The Biopsychosocial-Spiritual view treats the leak, not just the puddle.

### How to apply it

- **Biology**: reduce inflammation, restore sleep, and nourish the nervous system.
- **Psychology**: lower threat signals through calm practice and accurate information.
- **Social**: strengthen support, safety, and daily conditions that reduce load.
- **Spiritual**: reconnect with purpose so the body is not fighting against meaninglessness.

### What to look for

Relief feels different when the roof holds: breathing eases, vigilance drops, and recovery time shortens. Improvements last when all layers repair together.
