            title="Why did things improve, but still not feel better?"
            answer="Because treatments reduced symptoms, but the deeper conditions shaping your body, mind, life, and sense of meaning did not change."
          >
            <p>Imagine living in a house with a slow leak in the roof.</p>
            <p>At first, water drips onto the floor. You slip. You panic. It feels urgent.</p>
            <p>So you act.</p>
            <p>You wipe the floor every morning. You place a bucket under the drip. On bad days, you carry an umbrella inside the house.</p>
            <p>Each solution helps. The floor stays dry. Life becomes manageable again.</p>
            <p>From the outside, it looks solved.</p>
            <p>But every time it rains, your body tightens. You listen for the drip. You plan your life around it.</p>
            <p className="font-medium">
              Healing doesn’t feel like better buckets. Healing feels like the roof being fixed.
            </p>
          </Details>

          <Details
            title="Why didn’t anyone look at the real cause?"
            answer="Because modern systems are trained to treat visible problems, not the conditions that create them."
          >
            <p>We were taught to solve problems by fixing what we can see.</p>
            <p>Wet floor? → Clean it.</p>
            <p>Pain present? → Treat the pain.</p>
            <p>
              This way of thinking comes from an education system designed for efficiency and specialization.
              Each person is trained to fix a part. No one is responsible for the whole.
            </p>
            <p>Looking up at the roof isn’t assigned to anyone. So it never happens.</p>
          </Details>

          <Details
            title="Why did the treatments still help?"
            answer="Because managing symptoms prevents damage and allows survival, even if it cannot create healing."
          >
            <p>Buckets matter. Mopping matters.</p>
            <p>If you ignore the water, the house rots faster.</p>

              <li>pain decreases</li>

            title="What exactly is healthcare doing well?"
            answer="Healthcare is very good at managing harm once stress and illness are already inside the body."
          >
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Mopping the floor</strong> → painkillers, anti-inflammatories</li>
              <li><strong>Placing buckets</strong> → blood-pressure drugs, antiplatelets, cholesterol medications</li>
              <li><strong>Sweeping water away</strong> → sugar control, acid suppression, organ-protective drugs</li>

          <Details
            title="Why doesn’t my body ever fully relax?"
            answer="Because the body keeps responding to ongoing stress, even when symptoms are controlled."

            title="What is the Biopsychosocial-Spiritual (BPSS) view of health?"
            answer="BPSS views health as the result of how the body, mind, social conditions, and sense of meaning interact together."

              <li><strong>Biological</strong> — body and physiology</li>

          <Details
            title="How does this relate to the leaking roof?"
            answer="The roof represents all four BPSS layers working together to keep stress out of the body."
          >
            <p>A roof is not one surface.</p>
            <p>It is a system of layers.</p>
            <p>Water leaks only when several layers fail together.</p>
            <p className="mb-6">Human suffering works the same way.</p>

            <SubDetails
              title="Biology — the body’s sensitivity and wear"
              answer="Biology determines how easily stress turns into symptoms."

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>nervous system sensitivity</li>

                <li>exhaustion</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Medicine is excellent at limiting damage once stress breaks through.</p>
              <p>It does not remove the stress itself.</p>
            </SubDetails>

            <SubDetails
              title="Psychology — the internal load"
              answer="Psychological strain keeps the body in a constant state of alert."
            >
              <p>Chronic stress, fear, unresolved grief, and pressure bend the system over time.</p>
              <p>When this load never lifts, symptoms return — even with treatment.</p>
            </SubDetails>

            <SubDetails
              title="Social conditions — the environment you live in"
              answer="Social conditions decide whether stress keeps returning every day."
            >
              <p>Unsafe work, isolation, instability, and lack of rest are like constant storms.</p>
              <p>If the storm never stops, leaks return.</p>
            </SubDetails>

            <SubDetails
              title="Spiritual / meaning — why you are living this life"
              answer="A lack of meaning keeps the system under strain, even when everything else improves."

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>“Why am I doing this?”</li>

              <p>So do lives without meaning.</p>

            <SubDetails
              title="When does suffering actually begin?"
              answer="Suffering begins when biological strain, psychological stress, social pressure, and loss of meaning act together."
            >
              <p>Pain, fatigue, anxiety, illness — these are not the roof.</p>
              <p>They are water on the floor.</p>
              <p>Signals, not failures.</p>
            </SubDetails>
          </Details>

          <Details
            title="Why is BPSS / holistic care necessary?"
            answer="Because only a whole-system approach can stop stress from entering the body at its source."

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>caring for the body</li>

              When all four change together, the leak stops.

          <Details
            title="What does this mean for Me?"
            answer="If my symptoms improved but didn’t heal, it means I adapted to the problem instead of removing it."
          >
            <p>That’s not weakness. That’s intelligence under pressure.</p>
            <p>
              Healing begins when the question changes from
              <br />
              “How do I manage this?”
              <br />
              to
              <br />
              “Why is this still happening at all?”
            </p>
          </Details>

          <Details

            <p>You were never failing.</p>
            <p>You were never ungrateful.</p>

              Healing begins the moment the whole roof enters the frame.
